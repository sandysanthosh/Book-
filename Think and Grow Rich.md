Key Principles from the Book:

1. Desire

Strong, burning desire is the starting point of all achievement.

You must want your goal so badly that it becomes an obsession.


2. Faith

Believe in yourself and your ability to succeed.

Visualization and affirmation are tools to build belief.


3. Autosuggestion

Repeating affirmations daily programs your subconscious mind toward success.


4. Specialized Knowledge

General knowledge isn’t enough—get specific skills related to your goal.


5. Imagination

Use creative and synthetic imagination to turn ideas into plans.


6. Organized Planning

Take action on your goals with well-structured, flexible plans.


7. Decision

Successful people make decisions quickly and change them slowly.


8. Persistence

Keep going even when things get tough. Persistence separates the successful from the rest.


9. The Master Mind

Surround yourself with a group of like-minded people who support your goal.


10. The Subconscious Mind

Train it by feeding it positive thoughts, emotions, and goals.


11. The Brain

Your brain is like a broadcasting and receiving station—be mindful of the thoughts you send and receive.


12. The Sixth Sense

A mysterious "gut feeling" or intuition that comes after mastering the previous principles.
