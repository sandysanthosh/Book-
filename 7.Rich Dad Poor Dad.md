Book Title: Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!

Author: Robert T. Kiyosaki
Published: 1997


---

Summary:

Rich Dad Poor Dad is based on Robert Kiyosaki’s life, where he compares the advice and mindset of two father figures:

Rich Dad (his best friend’s dad) – a wealthy, financially savvy entrepreneur.

Poor Dad (his biological father) – a highly educated but financially struggling man.


The book explores how rich people think and act differently when it comes to money, work, and investing.

Key Lessons:

1. The Rich Don’t Work for Money

Poor people work for money. Rich people make money work for them through investments and passive income.


2. Financial Education Is Key

Schools teach academics, not financial intelligence.

Learn about money, investing, assets, and liabilities yourself.


3. Know the Difference Between Assets and Liabilities

Assets put money in your pocket (e.g., stocks, rental property, businesses).

Liabilities take money out (e.g., loans, big houses, fancy cars).

Focus on building assets, not collecting liabilities.


4. Mind Your Own Business

Even if you have a job, work on building your own income streams (like investments or a side hustle).


5. The Power of Corporations

Rich people use legal entities (corporations) to protect and grow their wealth.


6. Work to Learn, Not to Earn

Don’t just chase high-paying jobs—develop skills in sales, leadership, investing, and communication.

Why it’s valuable:

It completely changes how you think about money. It’s a mindset shift from spending to investing, from employee to owner, and from income to wealth.

Would you like me to recommend a book on relationships, spiritual growth, or something entrepreneurship/startup-related next?
