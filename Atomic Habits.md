Core Concepts:

1. The Power of Atomic Habits

Small habits compound over time.

1% improvement every day = big transformation over months/years.


2. The Four Laws of Behavior Change:

Make It Obvious

Use cues and triggers to remind you of the habit.

Example: Leave your gym clothes out the night before.


Make It Attractive

Pair the habit with something enjoyable (temptation bundling).

Example: Listen to your favorite podcast only while running.


Make It Easy

Reduce friction; simplify your environment.

Example: Want to read more? Leave a book on your pillow.


Make It Satisfying

Add immediate rewards to reinforce the habit.

Example: Mark an X on your habit tracker every day you succeed.

Advanced Tips:

Habit stacking: Link a new habit to an existing one.
“After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 2 minutes.”

Identity-based habits: Focus on becoming the type of person you want to be.
Instead of saying “I want to write,” say “I am a writer.”

Environment > Motivation: Shape your surroundings to support good habits.
