The 6 High Performance Habits:

1. Seek Clarity

Know who you are, what you want, and what matters.

Ask yourself: Who do I want to be? What’s my mission today?

Be intentional about your goals, energy, and relationships.


2. Generate Energy

High performers create energy through proper sleep, movement, nutrition, and passion.

They bring positive vibes and physical vitality to every task.


3. Raise Necessity

Make success a must, not a maybe.

Connect your goals to something bigger than yourself—purpose, family, mission.

Use identity and accountability as motivation tools.


4. Increase Productivity

Focus on your needle-moving activities (the 20% that brings 80% of results).

Avoid distractions, set clear deadlines, and block time.


5. Develop Influence

Be a role model, inspire others, and lead with empathy.

Help others grow and succeed along the way.


6. Demonstrate Courage

Speak up, take bold actions, and push past fear.

High performers act even when it’s uncomfortable or risky.
