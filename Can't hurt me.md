Key Takeaways:

1. Callous Your Mind
Just like hands develop calluses, your mind gets tougher the more you challenge it. Suffering is the path to growth.


2. The 40% Rule
When your mind says you're done, you're only at 40% of your capacity. Push beyond.


3. Accountability Mirror
Face the brutal truth. Look in the mirror and hold yourself accountable—no sugarcoating.


4. Taking Souls
Outwork and outperform to mentally dominate those who doubt you. Be so relentless it breaks them.


5. The Cookie Jar
When life gets hard, mentally reach into your "cookie jar" of past wins and struggles you've overcome. Draw strength from them.


6. Embrace the Suck
Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Pain and discomfort are training grounds for greatness.


7. No One is Coming to Save You
You are responsible for your life. No excuses. No one’s going to hand you success.
