Talking to anyone — whether a stranger, colleague, or potential connection — is a skill you can build with a few key principles. Here's a simple guide to help:

1. Start with a Smile and Openness

A genuine smile breaks the ice.

Keep open body language (no crossed arms, maintain eye contact).


2. Start with Easy Topics

Use simple openers:
“Hi, how’s your day going?”
“That’s a cool watch — where’d you get it?”

Ask about something in the environment or mutual context (event, weather, etc.).


3. Use the FORD Technique (for deeper convos)

Ask about:

Family: "Do you have any siblings?"

Occupation: "What do you do for work?"

Recreation: "What do you like to do in your free time?"

Dreams: "Any goals you're working on this year?"


4. Be a Good Listener

Let them talk. Show interest. Nod and use phrases like: “That’s interesting!” or “Tell me more.”


5. Find Common Ground

Look for shared interests, experiences, or opinions to build a bond.


6. Match Their Energy

If they’re quiet, be calm and patient.

If they’re energetic, be a bit more upbeat too.


7. Have Conversation Starters Ready

Current events (non-controversial)

Hobbies and entertainment (music, movies, travel)


8. Exit Gracefully If Needed

Say something like: “It was great chatting with you! I’ll catch you later.”


If you tell me the context — like a networking event, date, or team meeting — I can tailor tips even more. Want that?
